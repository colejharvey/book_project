## Principals, agents, and electoral manipulation

Electoral manipulation refers here to illegal efforts to influence the outcome of an election, including activities like vote-buying and tampering with election returns, but excluding legal mechanisms of biasing election results. Electoral manipulation has a variety of benefits for candidates and leaders: it can send a signal about the ruling party’s organizational capacity and staying power to other political actors [@gehlbach2015electoral;@simpser2013], and can induce ambitious politicians to join with the ruling party and help prevent elite splits [@magaloni2006], leaving opposition parties to recruit from a pool of relatively extreme ideological activists [@greene_why_2007]. Despite these benefits, there is wide variation in the severity of electoral manipulation [@simpser2013]. 

Previous research has identified a variety of factors that affect the prevalence of electoral manipulation, including inequality in wealth and power [@lehoucq2002;@ziblatt2009], poverty [@nichter2008;@simpser2013;@stokes2005], education levels [@kitschelt2007], and urbanization [@birch2011;@dominguez1998democratizing;@lehoucq2002]. Additionally, dense ethnic networks can make manipulation more appealing, by easing the monitoring of voters and reducing the likelihood that misdeeds will be exposed [@Goodnow2014;@hale2007correlates], while population size is negatively correlated with tampering [@lehoucq2002;@nichter2008;@simpser2013]. Corruption levels [@birch2011] and electoral system design [@Birch2007] also influence manipulation. 

The competitiveness of the electoral environment has been identified as a central factor in several theories, first a positive driver of manipulation [@argersinger1985new;@lehoucq2003;@lehoucq2002;@ziblatt2009]. However, Simpser [-@simpser2013] convincingly argues that ruling parties with few constraints and large resource advantages engage in excessive manipulation in uncompetitive environments as a signal of dominance. While this argument helps explain the puzzle of excessive electoral manipulation, its implications are less clear for cases in which dominant ruling parties fail to deliver excessive manipulation; principal-agent models can offer an explanation. 

Unlike many prior formal-theoretic models of electoral manipulation [@gehlbach2015electoral;@little_elections_2012;@magaloni2010], Rundlett and Svolik [-@rundlett2016deliver] devise a formal principal-agent and collective-action model of electoral manipulation in which manipulation is deterred not by leaders’ fear of protest but by front-line agents’ fear or punishment. Their approach usefully addresses both excessive manipulation and under-production of manipulation by strong governments. However, it has two main limitations, which this paper addresses. First, the model assumes that all forms of electoral manipulation are equally subject to principal-agent problems. However, electoral manipulation tactics are known to shift in response to changes in the local environment. For example, the presence of election monitors has been shown to lead to increases in harder-to-observe tactics such as voter pressure and covert spending to help favored candidates [@simpser_can_2012;@Beaulieu2008], along with  increased falsification in unmonitored precincts [@sjoberg_autocratic_2013]. Likewise, increased local competitiveness is associated with more vote-buying and voter pressure, and less administrative fraud [@harvey_manipulation_2016]. The incumbent-popularity model does not account for these differences, since it predicts that all types of electoral manipulation should rise and fall with the leader’s popular support. 

Second, the assumption that agents’ local political environment serves only as a signal of the principal’s unknown national popularity obscures two important features of electoral authoritarian politics: that an incumbent’s popularity is only one aspect of her overall likelihood of retaining office [@Gerschewski2013], and that local politics in some regions can be sufficiently open and competitive as to meaningfully constrain the ruling party’s freedom of action [@Belokurova2011]. 

In short, the model advanced by Rundlett and Svolik [-@rundlett2016deliver] is a significant step forward in understanding electoral manipulation, but the underlying mechanisms driving the model cannot account for observed local variation in manipulation tactics. The following theory addresses this puzzle by tying local risks to the type of manipulation employed by agents, and by broadening the conception of the incumbent’s staying power to include patronage resources rather than popularity alone. 

## Theory and hypotheses

For the purposes of this paper I consider a principal to be a national-level executive or party leader, while agents are the front-line individuals tasked with directly influencing election results by illegal means. As a result, I refer to principal-level effects as national, and agent-level effects as local. I argue that, while principals benefit from increased electoral manipulation, agents’ willingness to manipulate elections is conditional on two broad factors: the national consolidation of the patronage network the principal controls, and the local-level constraints faced by the agent. These two factors interact to influence agent behavior. When patronage networks are consolidated, agents have a strong incentive to participate in electoral manipulation on behalf of the dominant network; however, local factors like high partisan contestation can make engaging in manipulation risky for agents. Agents can reduce their exposure to local risk by shifting to harder-to-trace forms of electoral manipulation like vote-buying or voter pressure, rather than more easily monitored and traced activities like falsification.

In order to reap the benefits of electoral manipulation, political candidates must rely on large networks of agents to affect the results. These networks are usually pyramidal, with actors at each level responsible for overseeing a larger number of actors at the next level down [@auyero2007;@hale_patronal_2014]. Political candidates’ dependence on agents raises the possibility that agents’ may not always behave as the boss might prefer [@rundlett2016deliver}. 
	
Political principals can benefit directly from electoral manipulation [@greene_why_2007;@magaloni2006], since it improves their chance of winning close elections [@lehoucq2002], and widens the margin of victory [@simpser2013;@gehlbach2015electoral]. By contrast, agents do not directly benefit from each manufactured vote they generate. Instead, agents perform their assigned tasks in order to remain embedded within a principal’s patronage network. For example, Russia’s primary election-monitoring group recorded numerous incidents of voters being pressured to support the ruling party by their employers during the 2011 election. The following example is representative:

> At Kindergarten No. 620 [in St. Petersburg], a meeting was held in which employees were compelled to take absentee ballots in order to vote on school grounds. It was said that otherwise the district would be cut off from funding, but that voting by absentee would be rewarded with cash bonuses and time off. …It was pointed out that [Duma] Deputy S. Shatunovskii (a member of United Russia) had done a lot for the district and it was necessary to support him (Golos 2011).


As the anecdote illustrates, local school administrators pressured their employees with the risk of job loss and the promise of bonuses, in order to remain within the ruling party’s patronage network. This sort of voter pressure / vote-buying is common in sectors that rely on state patronage for their success [@frye2014]. Other forms of manipulation which rely more directly on state actors, such as ballot-stuffing or falsification of results, are also carried out in order to retain access to patronage. Principals in electoral authoritarian regimes tie access to the state and its associated opportunities for rents and patronage to electoral success [@diaz2006federalism;@lust-okar2006;@reuter2012subnational;@reuter2015], and can use the same resources to penalize opponents [@mcmann2006economic]. This creates a powerful incentive for local agents to boost the principal’s vote-share by whatever means are available, including misuse of the election administration apparatus, in order to remain within the privileged network. 

However, if the principal appears less likely to control access to patronage due to electoral defeat or intraparty rivalry, her offer of post-election patronage will appear less viable to agents, reducing their incentive to work on her behalf [@hale_democracy_2006]. Following Hale’s (2014) conception of ‘patronal politics,’ I argue that a principal’s ability to credibly promise post-election patronage is contingent on the share of resources controlled by her patronage network, relative to those of potential rivals.^[This corresponds to Hale’s (2014) conceptualization of “single-pyramid” and “multiple pyramid” patronage systems (p. 10).]  

When one patronage network controls a large share of resources, agents have a strong incentive to support the principal: access to rents and resources outside that network is limited, competing offers of patronage by opposition figures are necessarily discounted, and punishment of defectors by exclusion from the network seems assured [@hale_patronal_2014]. In a society characterized by multiple patronage networks, by contrast, the credibility of an individual principal’s offer is contingent on the likelihood that the principal will win the election or leadership struggle. As a result, clients ‘hedge their bets or pin their hopes on different networks in an uncoordinated fashion’ [@hale_patronal_2014, p. 72]. Consequently, agents are more strongly incentivized to participate in electoral manipulation efforts when patronage networks are more consolidated. 

However, conditions at the agent’s level can constrain agents’ ability to engage in manipulation, by increasing the risk of exposure and punishment, even if the principal’s access to patronage appears secure. Local agents are valuable to principals in part because of their deep knowledge of their local environment, which better enables them to monitor voters, distribute clientelistic benefits, or otherwise alter election results [@frye2014;@zarazaga2014brokers]. However, this local knowledge also allows agents to make strategic judgments about the level of local risk involved in manipulating an election. In more competitive settings, local agents have an ‘exit option,’ and may stop mobilizing voters or switch parties if the status quo becomes too risky [@stokes2013brokers, pp. 121-126]. A variety of political factors influence local risk. For example, when opposition parties have limited or no representation on election commissions, pro-incumbent manipulation is easier to accomplish and harder to expose [@kovalov_electoral_2014;@bader_osce_2012;@calingaert_election_2006]. The presence of election monitors deters election-day forms of electoral manipulation [@hyde_catch_2011;@sjoberg_autocratic_2013], and makes it more likely to be exposed [@Kelley2012]. Monitors are more likely to be present in politically open territories [@Buzin2016], and more likely to be effective in more competitive districts [@asunka2017electoral]. In cases where a dominant party machine exercises control over regional courts, opposition party figures are less likely to pursue complaints in regional courts [@popova2006], reducing the risk to agents of engaging in manipulation. Even authoritarian regimes may allow lower courts to remain somewhat independent, in order to reduce corruption, increase investment, and enhance regime legitimacy [@Moustafa2008]. In turn, these courts sometimes act to redress low-level electoral violations. For example, Popova [-@popova2012politicized] finds that district courts in Russia were more likely to hear election-related cases in competitive districts, and that pro-government candidates were not systematically more likely to win than pro-opposition candidates (pp. 94-95). By increasing risks to agents, local constraints affect the relative value of a principal’s offer of patronage; a particular patronage offer may be sufficient to convince an agent to engage in manipulation in a local setting where constraints are low, but insufficient in cases where constraints are higher. As a result, the interaction of patronage and constraints affects the level of manipulation observed. 
 
Qualitative evidence indicates that this effect is not purely driven by leaders’ fear of losing legitimacy. Exposed agents can face punishment, even in relatively uncompetitive regimes in which incumbent leaders retain power. A report on the punishment of election commissioners for violations of the election law from 2009 to 2015 in Russia found that, while most infractions are punished by small fines, significant punishments could be brought in cases with sufficient local political pressure [@golos__2015]. In some cases recorded by the monitoring group, election commissioners were found guilty of criminal offenses and faced stiff penalties, including fines of over half an average annual salary. 

In addition, I conducted field interviews during the autumn of 2015 also provide first-person accounts of the importance of patronage consolidation and local constraints in determining the severity of electoral manipulation. Given the political context in Russia during this time period—in which civil society groups like Golos and the Levada Center were being branded as foreign agents for accepting Western funds—respondents were understandably reluctant to discuss electoral manipulation with an American researcher, even when assured of anonymity.^[Also around this time, Western researchers were not infrequently being expelled from Russia and given multi-year bans from entering the country, even when they were not studying politically sensitive subjects.]  Nevertheless, I conducted roughly a dozen semi-structured interviews with election-monitoring organizers, academics, election monitors, and precinct election commissioners.

On the subject of local constraints, one election monitor made the following representative comment, when asked how electoral manipulation could be reduced by regional authorities:

> The [local] administrations still have lots of United Russia representatives, school directors, and so on. A governor can't change this structure quickly, even if he wants to. It requires lots of work and attention. He can't change the overall structure of the electoral commissions, which are mostly representatives of the state. This would be better if there were more representatives from parties and civil society on the commissions. The system here doesn't work. By the system, I mean journalists, courts, and punishment for manipulators.


An academic expert highlighted the importance of local constraints by noting the success of election monitoring during a gubernatorial election in Irkutsk, in which the Communist Party candidate won—a first since the reestablishment of gubernatorial elections.

> In the recent gubernatorial election in Irkutsk, KPRF deputies from the State Duma monitored the election, people with national clout. They were able to engage in a highly concentrated monitoring effort, which can't be done at the federal level. And this was successful.


The significance of the consolidation of patronage resources was a constant theme. One election monitor said the following:

> Administrative resources are not part of the parties, per se, they exist independently--they're part of the structure. The structure stays mostly the same, even if the parties change (for example, the staffs of the electoral commissions). The power vertical is too well constructed…. Manipulation requires administrative resources to work, and the security forces are used to punish illegal agitation. Without financing from the gray / black budget, it doesn't work. If administrative resources exist, then manipulation exists.

Another expert put it this way:
> In the 2011 election, why was the outcome worse than expected for the ruling party? Weak governors couldn’t produce good outcomes. There was a lack of trust in the political elite, which made local actors less likely to believe they will be protected by those above them.

In sum, a greater local risk of exposure and punishment can make participating in manipulation less appealing to agents. However, this effect does not mean that incumbents are unable to find agents willing to manipulate elections in competitive, monitored localities; instead, agents can choose to engage in forms of electoral manipulation that are more difficult to observe and trace back to perpetrators. Agents who engage in forms of manipulation that take place in in the polling center or the election administration are more exposed to local risks, since these activities are easier to observe and to attribute to their perpetrators. These forms of manipulation are usually carried out by agents who occupy a public, official position in the election administration and/or political parties [@birch2011, p. 61]. Election commissioners, for example, have a variety of means by which they can influence election results. However, discrepancies are easily traced back to them, especially when there is political and legal pressure to do so. By contrast, forms of electoral manipulation that are more dispersed—like vote-buying and voter-pressure—are harder to observe and to trace back to organizers, who may be employers [@frye2014], neighborhood brokers [@stokes2013brokers], and other non-state actors [@mares2016buying]. Unlike more centralized tactics, partisan and civil-society monitors do not know where and when to look for these activities, making them more difficult to trace than direct manipulation of the election administration [@birch2011]. For example, a Russian NGO report finds that the phrase ‘unidentified persons’ arises frequently in criminal cases against election commissioners, to designate the shadowy individuals who coordinate multiple-voting rings, and pay or intimidate commissioners to influence the vote. Lack of evidence means these unidentified persons are rarely called to account [@golos__2015]. This is not to say that vote-buying, voter pressure, and related tactics are impossible to detect. Rather, the nature of this kind of clientelistic exchange\textemdash in which brokers often know their clients directly, can exercise their political influence in clients’ day-to-day life, and benefit from either an asymmetrical power relationship [@frye2014] or a sense of trust [@kramon_2016]\textemdash makes these techniques harder for monitoring organizations to expose. 

An objection might be raised: do agents in competitive circumstances have an incentive to work especially hard for their principals, in order to deliver as many votes as possible and possibly keep the boss in office? This could be true in exceptional circumstances, but in most cases the number of votes that any individual agent can influence has a negligible effect on the overall result. This creates the coordination problem identified by Rundlett and Svolik [-@rundlett2016deliver]. As the election becomes more competitive, the efforts of more agents are necessary to secure victory; at the same time, the diminishing prospect of success makes it less likely that so many agents will in fact cooperate.

Finally, manipulation on a national scale can be very expensive, and principals’ resources are not limitless. Even relatively cost-effective tactics like co-opting employers to pressure voters requires monitoring efforts and rewards for compliant businesses [@frye2014, p. 207]. Agents and brokers engaged in falsification or other types of manipulation must still be organized and compensated [@Langston2009mexico]. Vote-buying, however, is especially costly [@lehoucq2002;@wang2007], and such efforts become increasingly expensive as competitiveness increases [@corstange2018clientelism]. As a result, incumbents are likely to prefer centralized forms of manipulation in low risk areas, due to their cost-effectiveness. This pattern has been documented both domestically in Russia [@harvey_manipulation_2016] and cross-nationally [@vanham2015sticks]. Consequently, if higher local constraints make agents less willing to tamper with elections in administrative ways, principals may find agents both more expensive to hire (as they turn toward vote-buying and similar tactics) and more likely to shirk their duties on election day (as they become harder to monitor). This limits the ability of principals to compensate for higher competitiveness by boosting payments for agents. 

In summary, national patronage consolidation attracts election-manipulating agents, but this attraction must be weighed against risks created by local political conditions.  Agents are more willing to tamper with elections when incumbent’s control of patronage appears more secure. However, where local constraints are high, agents engage in harder-to-trace manipulation in order to insulate themselves from the risks of exposure. Since cost-efficient manipulation by election administrators does little to protect agents from exposure, they are more willing to perform activities like falsification in places where local risks are already low. Two testable hypotheses can be drawn from this theory.  A third hypothesis tests the corresponding prediction from the incumbent popularity model. 

> Hypothesis 1: Higher local constraints will be associated with more vote-buying and voter pressure as patronage consolidation increases.

> Hypothesis 2: Lower local constraints will be associated with more falsification as patronage consolidation increases.

> Hypothesis 3 (incumbent popularity): Increases in the principal’s national approval rating will be associated with higher levels of  falsification, vote-buying, and voter pressure, especially in regions where the ruling party is popular.\end{quote}

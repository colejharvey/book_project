## Two theories of election manipulation

- What is electoral manipulation?
  - In this book, focus is on illegal electoral manipulation.
  - Look to Schedler chain of democratic choice to explain
  - See also Simpser 2011 p. 35 on three goals of his definition, and what tactics he includes
    - In particular, he notes the analytic importance of choice (someone is making a deliberate choice to manipulate)

- Measuring electoral manipulation
  -Pros and cons of:
    - Election observation
    - Survey reports
    - Crowdsourcing
    - Election forensics
    - Expert ratings
  - This book uses multiple measures

- Note distinction between decisive and severe manipulation. 
  - Manipulation can be severe and non-decisive, or decisive and mild
  
- Simpser's first conventional wisdom: "The first approach is predicated on the idea that the main– in
 fact, the only– goal of electoral manipulation is to contribute to winning the
 election at hand.1 This idea, and its implications about when and how electoral
 manipulation is likely to be pursued, is implicitly or explicitly espoused in most
 of the literature on the topic, and therefore I shall call it the first conventional
 wisdom about electoral manipulation." (cites: In this first approach I include scholarship on both democratic and authoritarian electoral systems, where the latter category includes the work by Geddes (2006), Magaloni (2006), Greene (2007), and other authors,)
  - Other sources on first conventional wisdom: These cover Costa Rica in the first half of the twentieth century (Lehoucq and Molina 1999, 2002), Spain during the Restoration (Darde 1996), Germany in the late nineteenth century (Ziblatt 2009), Argentina at the turn of the twentieth century (Alonso 1996), Victorian England (Kam 2008), and the United States at various points in its history (Cox and Kousser 1981;
 Argersinger 1985;King2001; Campbell 2003, 2005; among others) +  monograph by James Scott (1972), a study of electoral practices in Latin  America in the nineteenth century by Eduardo Posada-Carb´ o (2000), a famous article by  Schedler in which he surveys the different tools of electoral manipulation (2002), and two
 recent edited volumes by Schaffer, one devoted to vote buying and the other to electoral reform
 (2007, 2008). Lehoucq (2003) is a survey article +  Including Carothers 1997; Bjornlund 2004; Hartlyn and McCoy2006;Hyde2006,2011;Hyde and Marinov 2008; Kelley 2008; Simpser 2008; Beaulieu 2009; Beaulieu and Hyde 2009;and Simpser and Donno 2012.(Latter group is on election monitoring--could be an important literature to connect in)
  - Core idea: "Manipulated elections are associated with small margins of victory... manipulating elections requires considerable effort, money, and personnel, and can lead to punishment or redress." So don't manipulate too much!
  - Core idea 2 (from Simpser): "third idea is that electoral manipulation will be kept secret– that perpetrators as a rule seek to hide their activities of electoral manipulation from public view, presumably to avoid punishment. This assumption runs deep in the literature; it is virtually unquestioned."
  --- THE core idea from Simpser: "In particular, electoral manipulation can influence behavior in two capacities: as a coordination device, and as a source of information about the manipulator’s attributes. In both capacities, electoral manipulation provides information about party strength." (P. 81)
  
- This first approach is what I call the 'regime weakness' model of electoral manipulation. It rests on two assumptions
  - 1) Election manipulation carries significant 'legitimacy costs' for the incumbent
  - 2) Electoral manipulation conveys little information about incumbent resilience, at best, and evidence of incumbent weakness at worst.
  
- Regime weakness model shows up most clearly in formal models (due to the necessity of clarity in such models), but is also implicit in informal theory
  - Little, Tucker, and LaGatta (2015):  "Just as stronger election results for the incumbent lead to less protest because they indicate that she is popular, reports of more fraud lead to more protest because they indicate that the incumbent is, for a given election result, less popular."
  - In Little (2015), an incumbent chooses an amount of fraud that decreases in the effectiveness of election monitoring--the "audience" offers less support to an unpopular incumbent, and undetected fraud reduces the audience's certainty around the level of popularity. So weak incumbents manipulate more than strong ones, but this effect declines in the degree of monitoring.
  - Magaloni 2010: "The legitimacy loss of fraud can be conceived as the costs to the autocrat of damaging its reputation before its own supporters and/or before the international community.4 The model thus assumes that if fraud is known, it will invariably be costly for the incumbent." (This loss is modeled as the loss of some of the incumbent's present supporters).
    - Note that probability of winning post-election conflict is modeled as distinct from popularity
    - One way that 'weakness' can be conceptualized in this model is the cohesiveness of the incumbent coalition. If few members would defect after fraud, then ever-riskier gambles on fraud become rational. See page 758, column 1 for utility equation
    
- But it also shows up implicitly in other, informal theories
  - Election manipulation can serve as a coordination device for aggrieved citizens (Tucker 2007)
  - See literature on electoral manipulation (Hyde and Marinov 2014; Kelley 2012)
  - Masaaki Higashijima (2022): "Two scenarios can emerge where elections destabilize authoritarian rule. In the first, a dictator engages in excessive electoral manipulation to such a degree that it harms the benefits of elections. This makes it **difficult for opposition leaders to correctly estimate the dictator’s true strength and makes it easy to capitalize on popular grievance**, provoking popular protest." (p.10)
    -Expects protest when manipulation is extensive; regime survival depends on electoral margins and elite decisions (p. 44)
    - Higashijima focuses on mobilizational capacity of dictators, which is also in line with my approach
    
    
- Higashijima on fraud and protest:
  - "Popular protests are more likely to occur when dictators excessively manipulate elections in the following three mechanisms. First, excessive electoral manipulation widens a gap between the opposition’s belief in their strength and revealed election outcomes, which in turn may encourage opposition leaders to speculate that the
regimes are weaker than they had previously thought." (p. 169)
  - "Second, excessive electoral manipulation unifies the opposition camp. Pro- regime electoral manipulation—blatant electoral fraud and majoritarian electoral systems— is more likely to prevent opposition parties from gaining their legislative representation and political influence within the regime. The extreme pro-regime bias in elections, however, undermines the credibility of electoral processes and thus urges the opposition to unify in adopting anti-system approaches, including post-electoral popular protests, rather than participating in regime- sponsored elections. (p. 170)
  - "Third, excessive electoral manipulation serves as a coordination mechanism for the opposition to overcome collective action problems and leads to protest movements in the aftermath of elections (Tucker 2007).
Organizing and joining mass protests runs the risk of state repression--especially when participants are uncertain about whether other people would join them. In this context, as Knutsen, Nygård, and Wig (2017: 108)
succinctly point out, “elections constitute an easily identifiable focal points around which the expectations of different opposition actors, who otherwise cannot freely communicate, can converge. When first movers among
the opposition can coordinate, a collective action logic may generate further snowballing since the probability of success increases and the cost of participation decreases as the number of participants grows." (p. 170)
  - Higashijima finds that fraud in excess of predicted fraud (based on a first-stage model) is associated with greater risk of protest, but lower risk of incumbent turnover.
  - " The theory provides implications for political order after authoritarian elections. If the dictator is unable to strategically manipulate elections in dealing with the electoral dilemma, then authoritarian elections backfire on him. More specifically, there are two causal pathways through which elections threaten authoritarian stability. If the dictator employs excessive electoral manipulation, then he is more likely to face popular protests because electoral manipulation provides a focal point for collective action and also political elites find difficulty in making sense of the de facto strength of the regime. On the contrary, if the autocrat is overconfident about his election victory and fails to optimize electoral manipulation, then
election results reveal the weakness of the regime, leading to leadership turnover via a post-electoral coup or the opposition’s landslide election victory."
  - My argument is that incumbents will almost always want to over manipulate (as the data in his book suggests--it's always better to overmanipulate). Instead, low manipulation happens because of some breakdown in the P-A network (which itself may confound the relationship between manipulation and turnover).
    
    

- Regime strength model

- What does extensive manipulation require? Solving a principal-agent problem
- P-A nature of election manipulation
- How to solve?
  - Patronage resources (much discussion will be needed)
    - Mobilizational resources 
    - Incentives for supporting the boss
  - Legal impunity for agents
  - Birch (2020) notes how these features can be used to produce electoral violence that backstops other forms of manipulation
    -"In contexts of dominance by informal institutions and corruption, those who control the levers of political power also control vast economic resources, as access to opportunities to generate wealth is guarded by political elites who typically allocate such opportunities to their allies in order to shore up their support bases, to those who offer them kickbacks, or in some cases to opposition elites whom they seek to co-opt. Legal mechanisms are highly politicized in these settings, such that incumbent allies enjoy virtual
immunity from prosecution, whereas legal sanctions are applied often without justification against the political opponents of those in power. Finally, the public sector itself is a considerable source of patronage and wealth in states dominated by informal institutions and corruption, especially in underdeveloped contexts where private-sector enterprise is limited and the state is heavily reliant on foreign aid, most of which passes through state coffers (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012; Berenschot 2018b; Helmke and Levitsky 2006; Kitschelt and Wilkinson 2007; Mungiu-Pippidi 2015; North, Wallis, and Weingast 2009; Rothstein 2011; Rothstein and Varraich 2017)" (p. 29)
  - "At the same time, violence will be kept in check if democratic institutions restrain the abuse of power and penalize the use of illicit force. Though corruption is found even in many democracies (Fisman and Golden 2017), democratic mechanisms go some way toward curbing the use of violence to enforce corrupt exchanges and to prevent whistle-blowers from denouncing corrupt transactions. When accountability institutions are strong, the real threat of legal penalty and/or social sanction embodied in democratic institutions raises the cost of corruption as well as that of violent means of facilitating it." (p. 31)
  - "Moreover, informal institutions of patronage and clientelism reduce the risk of prosecution for regime allies, making violence more attractive for incumbents—and sometimes for opposition elites, if they believe they can bribe their way out of prosecution for criminal acts. Electoral corruption can also be used to buy off opponents." (p. 33)
  - "Electoral misconduct often relies on violence or the threat of violence to be effective, as the fear generated by the use of force facilitates the successful manipulation of electoral procedures; put another way, the possibility of violence softens populations up for fraud, and ensures that if fraud fails the leadership will nevertheless achieve its ends." (p. 36)
  
- Extensive manipulation reveals these capacities, while also (perhaps) coordinating public grievances. This reuslts in:
  - Post-election protest increasing in manipulation
  - Protest failure increasing in manipulation
  - Protest risk having a null or positive effect on election manipulation (contrary to widespread expectation)
    - Higajishima does predict that greater opposition organizing capacity -> more fraud, because it is even riskier to let the well-organized opposition compete fairly
    

- Trejo (2014) argues that social movements and political parties in authoritarian systems protest fraud instrumentally (i.e. as a framing device)
  - When elections become more free and fair (perhaps for reasons orthogonal to protest), opposition parties attempt to demobilize their social movement allies (to downplay the sense of 'being extreme').

 


## Principals, agents, and electoral manipulation

Electoral manipulation refers here to illegal efforts to influence the outcome of an election, including activities like vote-buying and tampering with election returns, but excluding legal mechanisms of biasing election results. Electoral manipulation has a variety of benefits for candidates and leaders: it can send a signal about the ruling party’s organizational capacity and staying power to other political actors [@gehlbach2015electoral;@simpser2013], and can induce ambitious politicians to join with the ruling party and help prevent elite splits [@magaloni2006], leaving opposition parties to recruit from a pool of relatively extreme ideological activists [@greene_why_2007]. Despite these benefits, there is wide variation in the severity of electoral manipulation [@simpser2013]. 

Previous research has identified a variety of factors that affect the prevalence of electoral manipulation, including inequality in wealth and power [@lehoucq2002;@ziblatt2009], poverty [@nichter2008;@simpser2013;@stokes2005], education levels [@kitschelt2007], and urbanization [@birch2011;@dominguez1998democratizing;@lehoucq2002]. Additionally, dense ethnic networks can make manipulation more appealing, by easing the monitoring of voters and reducing the likelihood that misdeeds will be exposed [@Goodnow2014;@hale2007correlates], while population size is negatively correlated with tampering [@lehoucq2002;@nichter2008;@simpser2013]. Corruption levels [@birch2011] and electoral system design [@Birch2007] also influence manipulation. 

The competitiveness of the electoral environment has been identified as a central factor in several theories, first a positive driver of manipulation [@argersinger1985new;@lehoucq2003;@lehoucq2002;@ziblatt2009]. However, Simpser [-@simpser2013] convincingly argues that ruling parties with few constraints and large resource advantages engage in excessive manipulation in uncompetitive environments as a signal of dominance. While this argument helps explain the puzzle of excessive electoral manipulation, its implications are less clear for cases in which dominant ruling parties fail to deliver excessive manipulation; principal-agent models can offer an explanation. 

Unlike many prior formal-theoretic models of electoral manipulation [@gehlbach2015electoral;@little_elections_2012;@magaloni2010], Rundlett and Svolik [-@rundlett2016deliver] devise a formal principal-agent and collective-action model of electoral manipulation in which manipulation is deterred not by leaders’ fear of protest but by front-line agents’ fear or punishment. Their approach usefully addresses both excessive manipulation and under-production of manipulation by strong governments. However, it has two main limitations, which this paper addresses. First, the model assumes that all forms of electoral manipulation are equally subject to principal-agent problems. However, electoral manipulation tactics are known to shift in response to changes in the local environment. For example, the presence of election monitors has been shown to lead to increases in harder-to-observe tactics such as voter pressure and covert spending to help favored candidates [@simpser_can_2012;@Beaulieu2008], along with  increased falsification in unmonitored precincts [@sjoberg_autocratic_2013]. Likewise, increased local competitiveness is associated with more vote-buying and voter pressure, and less administrative fraud [@harvey_manipulation_2016]. The incumbent-popularity model does not account for these differences, since it predicts that all types of electoral manipulation should rise and fall with the leader’s popular support. 

Second, the assumption that agents’ local political environment serves only as a signal of the principal’s unknown national popularity obscures two important features of electoral authoritarian politics: that an incumbent’s popularity is only one aspect of her overall likelihood of retaining office [@Gerschewski2013], and that local politics in some regions can be sufficiently open and competitive as to meaningfully constrain the ruling party’s freedom of action [@Belokurova2011]. 

In short, the model advanced by Rundlett and Svolik [-@rundlett2016deliver] is a significant step forward in understanding electoral manipulation, but the underlying mechanisms driving the model cannot account for observed local variation in manipulation tactics. The following theory addresses this puzzle by tying local risks to the type of manipulation employed by agents, and by broadening the conception of the incumbent’s staying power to include patronage resources rather than popularity alone. 

## Theory and hypotheses

For the purposes of this paper I consider a principal to be a national-level executive or party leader, while agents are the front-line individuals tasked with directly influencing election results by illegal means. As a result, I refer to principal-level effects as national, and agent-level effects as local. I argue that, while principals benefit from increased electoral manipulation, agents’ willingness to manipulate elections is conditional on two broad factors: the national consolidation of the patronage network the principal controls, and the local-level constraints faced by the agent. These two factors interact to influence agent behavior. When patronage networks are consolidated, agents have a strong incentive to participate in electoral manipulation on behalf of the dominant network; however, local factors like high partisan contestation can make engaging in manipulation risky for agents. Agents can reduce their exposure to local risk by shifting to harder-to-trace forms of electoral manipulation like vote-buying or voter pressure, rather than more easily monitored and traced activities like falsification.

In order to reap the benefits of electoral manipulation, political candidates must rely on large networks of agents to affect the results. These networks are usually pyramidal, with actors at each level responsible for overseeing a larger number of actors at the next level down [@auyero2007;@hale_patronal_2014]. Political candidates’ dependence on agents raises the possibility that agents’ may not always behave as the boss might prefer [@rundlett2016deliver}. 
	
Political principals can benefit directly from electoral manipulation [@greene_why_2007;@magaloni2006], since it improves their chance of winning close elections [@lehoucq2002], and widens the margin of victory [@simpser2013;@gehlbach2015electoral]. By contrast, agents do not directly benefit from each manufactured vote they generate. Instead, agents perform their assigned tasks in order to remain embedded within a principal’s patronage network. For example, Russia’s primary election-monitoring group recorded numerous incidents of voters being pressured to support the ruling party by their employers during the 2011 election. The following example is representative:

> At Kindergarten No. 620 [in St. Petersburg], a meeting was held in which employees were compelled to take absentee ballots in order to vote on school grounds. It was said that otherwise the district would be cut off from funding, but that voting by absentee would be rewarded with cash bonuses and time off. …It was pointed out that [Duma] Deputy S. Shatunovskii (a member of United Russia) had done a lot for the district and it was necessary to support him (Golos 2011).


As the anecdote illustrates, local school administrators pressured their employees with the risk of job loss and the promise of bonuses, in order to remain within the ruling party’s patronage network. This sort of voter pressure / vote-buying is common in sectors that rely on state patronage for their success [@frye2014]. Other forms of manipulation which rely more directly on state actors, such as ballot-stuffing or falsification of results, are also carried out in order to retain access to patronage. Principals in electoral authoritarian regimes tie access to the state and its associated opportunities for rents and patronage to electoral success [@diaz2006federalism;@lust-okar2006;@reuter2012subnational;@reuter2015], and can use the same resources to penalize opponents [@mcmann2006economic]. This creates a powerful incentive for local agents to boost the principal’s vote-share by whatever means are available, including misuse of the election administration apparatus, in order to remain within the privileged network. 

However, if the principal appears less likely to control access to patronage due to electoral defeat or intraparty rivalry, her offer of post-election patronage will appear less viable to agents, reducing their incentive to work on her behalf [@hale_democracy_2006]. Following Hale’s (2014) conception of ‘patronal politics,’ I argue that a principal’s ability to credibly promise post-election patronage is contingent on the share of resources controlled by her patronage network, relative to those of potential rivals.^[This corresponds to Hale’s (2014) conceptualization of “single-pyramid” and “multiple pyramid” patronage systems (p. 10).]  

When one patronage network controls a large share of resources, agents have a strong incentive to support the principal: access to rents and resources outside that network is limited, competing offers of patronage by opposition figures are necessarily discounted, and punishment of defectors by exclusion from the network seems assured [@hale_patronal_2014]. In a society characterized by multiple patronage networks, by contrast, the credibility of an individual principal’s offer is contingent on the likelihood that the principal will win the election or leadership struggle. As a result, clients ‘hedge their bets or pin their hopes on different networks in an uncoordinated fashion’ [@hale_patronal_2014, p. 72]. Consequently, agents are more strongly incentivized to participate in electoral manipulation efforts when patronage networks are more consolidated. 

However, conditions at the agent’s level can constrain agents’ ability to engage in manipulation, by increasing the risk of exposure and punishment, even if the principal’s access to patronage appears secure. Local agents are valuable to principals in part because of their deep knowledge of their local environment, which better enables them to monitor voters, distribute clientelistic benefits, or otherwise alter election results [@frye2014;@zarazaga2014brokers]. However, this local knowledge also allows agents to make strategic judgments about the level of local risk involved in manipulating an election. In more competitive settings, local agents have an ‘exit option,’ and may stop mobilizing voters or switch parties if the status quo becomes too risky [@stokes2013brokers, pp. 121-126]. A variety of political factors influence local risk. For example, when opposition parties have limited or no representation on election commissions, pro-incumbent manipulation is easier to accomplish and harder to expose [@kovalov_electoral_2014;@bader_osce_2012;@calingaert_election_2006]. The presence of election monitors deters election-day forms of electoral manipulation [@hyde_catch_2011;@sjoberg_autocratic_2013], and makes it more likely to be exposed [@Kelley2012]. Monitors are more likely to be present in politically open territories [@Buzin2016], and more likely to be effective in more competitive districts [@asunka2017electoral]. In cases where a dominant party machine exercises control over regional courts, opposition party figures are less likely to pursue complaints in regional courts [@popova2006], reducing the risk to agents of engaging in manipulation. Even authoritarian regimes may allow lower courts to remain somewhat independent, in order to reduce corruption, increase investment, and enhance regime legitimacy [@Moustafa2008]. In turn, these courts sometimes act to redress low-level electoral violations. For example, Popova [-@popova2012politicized] finds that district courts in Russia were more likely to hear election-related cases in competitive districts, and that pro-government candidates were not systematically more likely to win than pro-opposition candidates (pp. 94-95). By increasing risks to agents, local constraints affect the relative value of a principal’s offer of patronage; a particular patronage offer may be sufficient to convince an agent to engage in manipulation in a local setting where constraints are low, but insufficient in cases where constraints are higher. As a result, the interaction of patronage and constraints affects the level of manipulation observed. 
 
Qualitative evidence indicates that this effect is not purely driven by leaders’ fear of losing legitimacy. Exposed agents can face punishment, even in relatively uncompetitive regimes in which incumbent leaders retain power. A report on the punishment of election commissioners for violations of the election law from 2009 to 2015 in Russia found that, while most infractions are punished by small fines, significant punishments could be brought in cases with sufficient local political pressure [@golos__2015]. In some cases recorded by the monitoring group, election commissioners were found guilty of criminal offenses and faced stiff penalties, including fines of over half an average annual salary. 

In addition, I conducted field interviews during the autumn of 2015 also provide first-person accounts of the importance of patronage consolidation and local constraints in determining the severity of electoral manipulation. Given the political context in Russia during this time period—in which civil society groups like Golos and the Levada Center were being branded as foreign agents for accepting Western funds—respondents were understandably reluctant to discuss electoral manipulation with an American researcher, even when assured of anonymity.^[Also around this time, Western researchers were not infrequently being expelled from Russia and given multi-year bans from entering the country, even when they were not studying politically sensitive subjects.]  Nevertheless, I conducted roughly a dozen semi-structured interviews with election-monitoring organizers, academics, election monitors, and precinct election commissioners.

On the subject of local constraints, one election monitor made the following representative comment, when asked how electoral manipulation could be reduced by regional authorities:

> The [local] administrations still have lots of United Russia representatives, school directors, and so on. A governor can't change this structure quickly, even if he wants to. It requires lots of work and attention. He can't change the overall structure of the electoral commissions, which are mostly representatives of the state. This would be better if there were more representatives from parties and civil society on the commissions. The system here doesn't work. By the system, I mean journalists, courts, and punishment for manipulators.


An academic expert highlighted the importance of local constraints by noting the success of election monitoring during a gubernatorial election in Irkutsk, in which the Communist Party candidate won—a first since the reestablishment of gubernatorial elections.

> In the recent gubernatorial election in Irkutsk, KPRF deputies from the State Duma monitored the election, people with national clout. They were able to engage in a highly concentrated monitoring effort, which can't be done at the federal level. And this was successful.


The significance of the consolidation of patronage resources was a constant theme. One election monitor said the following:

> Administrative resources are not part of the parties, per se, they exist independently--they're part of the structure. The structure stays mostly the same, even if the parties change (for example, the staffs of the electoral commissions). The power vertical is too well constructed…. Manipulation requires administrative resources to work, and the security forces are used to punish illegal agitation. Without financing from the gray / black budget, it doesn't work. If administrative resources exist, then manipulation exists.

Another expert put it this way:
> In the 2011 election, why was the outcome worse than expected for the ruling party? Weak governors couldn’t produce good outcomes. There was a lack of trust in the political elite, which made local actors less likely to believe they will be protected by those above them.

In sum, a greater local risk of exposure and punishment can make participating in manipulation less appealing to agents. However, this effect does not mean that incumbents are unable to find agents willing to manipulate elections in competitive, monitored localities; instead, agents can choose to engage in forms of electoral manipulation that are more difficult to observe and trace back to perpetrators. Agents who engage in forms of manipulation that take place in in the polling center or the election administration are more exposed to local risks, since these activities are easier to observe and to attribute to their perpetrators. These forms of manipulation are usually carried out by agents who occupy a public, official position in the election administration and/or political parties [@birch2011, p. 61]. Election commissioners, for example, have a variety of means by which they can influence election results. However, discrepancies are easily traced back to them, especially when there is political and legal pressure to do so. By contrast, forms of electoral manipulation that are more dispersed—like vote-buying and voter-pressure—are harder to observe and to trace back to organizers, who may be employers [@frye2014], neighborhood brokers [@stokes2013brokers], and other non-state actors [@mares2016buying]. Unlike more centralized tactics, partisan and civil-society monitors do not know where and when to look for these activities, making them more difficult to trace than direct manipulation of the election administration [@birch2011]. For example, a Russian NGO report finds that the phrase ‘unidentified persons’ arises frequently in criminal cases against election commissioners, to designate the shadowy individuals who coordinate multiple-voting rings, and pay or intimidate commissioners to influence the vote. Lack of evidence means these unidentified persons are rarely called to account [@golos__2015]. This is not to say that vote-buying, voter pressure, and related tactics are impossible to detect. Rather, the nature of this kind of clientelistic exchange\textemdash in which brokers often know their clients directly, can exercise their political influence in clients’ day-to-day life, and benefit from either an asymmetrical power relationship [@frye2014] or a sense of trust [@kramon_2016]\textemdash makes these techniques harder for monitoring organizations to expose. 

An objection might be raised: do agents in competitive circumstances have an incentive to work especially hard for their principals, in order to deliver as many votes as possible and possibly keep the boss in office? This could be true in exceptional circumstances, but in most cases the number of votes that any individual agent can influence has a negligible effect on the overall result. This creates the coordination problem identified by Rundlett and Svolik [-@rundlett2016deliver]. As the election becomes more competitive, the efforts of more agents are necessary to secure victory; at the same time, the diminishing prospect of success makes it less likely that so many agents will in fact cooperate.

Finally, manipulation on a national scale can be very expensive, and principals’ resources are not limitless. Even relatively cost-effective tactics like co-opting employers to pressure voters requires monitoring efforts and rewards for compliant businesses [@frye2014, p. 207]. Agents and brokers engaged in falsification or other types of manipulation must still be organized and compensated [@Langston2009mexico]. Vote-buying, however, is especially costly [@lehoucq2002;@wang2007], and such efforts become increasingly expensive as competitiveness increases [@corstange2018clientelism]. As a result, incumbents are likely to prefer centralized forms of manipulation in low risk areas, due to their cost-effectiveness. This pattern has been documented both domestically in Russia [@harvey_manipulation_2016] and cross-nationally [@vanham2015sticks]. Consequently, if higher local constraints make agents less willing to tamper with elections in administrative ways, principals may find agents both more expensive to hire (as they turn toward vote-buying and similar tactics) and more likely to shirk their duties on election day (as they become harder to monitor). This limits the ability of principals to compensate for higher competitiveness by boosting payments for agents. 

In summary, national patronage consolidation attracts election-manipulating agents, but this attraction must be weighed against risks created by local political conditions.  Agents are more willing to tamper with elections when incumbent’s control of patronage appears more secure. However, where local constraints are high, agents engage in harder-to-trace manipulation in order to insulate themselves from the risks of exposure. Since cost-efficient manipulation by election administrators does little to protect agents from exposure, they are more willing to perform activities like falsification in places where local risks are already low. Two testable hypotheses can be drawn from this theory.  A third hypothesis tests the corresponding prediction from the incumbent popularity model. 

> Hypothesis 1: Higher local constraints will be associated with more vote-buying and voter pressure as patronage consolidation increases.

> Hypothesis 2: Lower local constraints will be associated with more falsification as patronage consolidation increases.

> Hypothesis 3 (incumbent popularity): Increases in the principal’s national approval rating will be associated with higher levels of  falsification, vote-buying, and voter pressure, especially in regions where the ruling party is popular.\end{quote}

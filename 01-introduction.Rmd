# Introduction

When the last vestiges of the Soviet Union finally crumbled in December 1991, the dissipation of the old regime set in motion a process of decentralization within Russia itself: many of the newly-independent country’s regions sought to capture as much sovereignty from the center as they could swallow, to use President Boris Yeltsin’s famous phrase. While many of the old system’s levers of patronage and influence had passed into Yeltsin’s hands, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (KPRF) remained the only political party in the country that boasted a nationwide network of supporters, activists, and organizational infrastructure. These factors, combined with the economic pain of the transition to a market economy, resulted in the Communists’ victory in Russia’s first regularly scheduled legislative election, in December 1995, six months before Yeltsin himself was up for re-election. 

Yeltsin prevailed in that contest, despite Russia’s political fragmentation, a well-organized rival party in control of the legislature, difficult economic and social conditions, and approval ratings in the single digits a few months prior to the election. He accomplished this feat in no small part by drawing on the resources of the state and of allied business interests to manipulate media coverage, voters, and the election results. That an incumbent in such a challenging position could successfully manipulate an election is puzzling, since it flies in the face of dominant theories of electoral manipulation. Traditional theories of manipulation hold that it should be rare in just such a setting: where political competition is fierce and the risk of post-election protest is high. Similarly, more recent models that emphasize the staying-power of the leader—captured most clearly by approval ratings—drives local agents to participate in manipulation on his behalf; under this framework, Yeltsin’s dismal prospects after the KPRF victory in 1995 should have driven agents to play it safe. The outcome represented by Yeltsin’s victory in 1996 is one of the puzzles addressed by the theory presented in this manuscript: how can political candidates facing low popularity, internal political fragmentation, economic crisis, or other serious handicaps nevertheless produce enough electoral manipulation to win their elections?

Russian political history also provides a representative example of the second puzzle this project seeks to address. In important ways, the 2011 Russian legislative election was a mirror-image of the situation facing Yeltsin in 1996. The economy, while struggling to fully recover from the financial crisis of 2008, was growing. The country’s internal fragmentation had largely been arrested during President Vladimir Putin’s first two terms, in which regional authorities and wealthy oligarchs had both been brought firmly under the Kremlin’s influence. Six months from the election, Putin’s approval rating stood at 69 percent, and the ruling party—United Russia—was dominant in both the national legislature and in regional legislatures across the country. Despite these advantages, the ruling party suffered a significant defeat at the polls, losing 77 seats and its constitutional supermajority in the legislature. Even so, the results were tainted by widespread allegations of election manipulation, prompting a nationwide protest movement (Za Chestnye Vybory—For Fair Elections). The 2011 Russian election is an example of something close to the worst-case scenario for an electoral authoritarian leader: electoral defeat coupled with potentially destabilizing protest. That such a negative outcome occurred despite all of the advantages available to the ruling party represents the second puzzle studied here: how can incumbent leaders with strong states and deep resources sometimes fail to produce enough electoral manipulation to win the election and stave off mass protest?

This project offers a theory of electoral manipulation that explains both kinds of puzzling outcomes: ‘over-production’ of electoral manipulation by weak parties and ‘under-production’ by strong ones. In doing so it addresses broader research questions. Why does the severity of elections vary from country to country, within countries during the same election, and within the same territory from election to election? Why are different techniques used to bias electoral outcomes under different circumstances? And which actors drive that variation? I identity two explanatory factors that together account for type of electoral manipulation that is likely to occur in a particular case, as well as the severity. These are access to patronage resources on the one hand, and local risks to agents on the other. The appeal of participating in a rich patronage network draws agents to engage in electoral manipulation; leaders who have consolidated control over large patronage networks can generate more electoral manipulation as a result. However, local risks—public exposure, criminal penalties, and so on—make manipulation risky for agents.  These local risks are driven by factors like an independent and active media (which can investigate and publicize electoral malfeasance), an independent judiciary, and—most importantly—a large and active opposition party presence. These factors are generally not uniform features of a country, but tend to vary by locality. Just as democratic countries may have subnational authoritarian enclaves (Gibson, 2012), non-democratic countries may have pockets of elevated contestation and more active civil society (Gilley, 2010).

When local risks are high, agents are more likely to engage in forms of electoral manipulation that are difficult to observe and trace, in order to avoid exposure and punishment. These include tactics like vote-buying and voter pressure; agents who engage in these sorts of activities are difficult to monitor and track, since they take place at varying times on or before election day, and at places other than the polling station. As a result, I classify these hard-to-attribute methods as dispersed forms of manipulation. By contrast, techniques like falsification and ballot stuffing generally occur in the polling place on election day, making them easier to observe and for perpetrators to be identified. These are centralized tactics.

The model makes predictions for both the level and type of manipulation, summarized in Figure 1 and Table 1 below. In brief, when a leader’s control over patronage is low, manipulation on behalf of that party is relatively rare since inducing agents’ cooperation in the patronage network is difficult. It is least likely to occur in places where local risks to agents are high; if the leader controls enough patronage resources to attract election-manipulating agents, she is more likely to be able to do so in places agent risk is low. When leaders control a greater share of patronage resources, electoral manipulation increases in severity by tactic. In areas where opposition parties (in addition to independent media and courts) are weak, agents can engage in centralized manipulation like falsification of results. In high-risk areas agents are less likely to adopt centralized tactics, and more likely to engage in dispersed vote-buying and voter pressure. 

I test this theory using data from three country cases—Russia (2003-2012), Mexico (1994-2012), and Ukraine (2002-2014)—and multiple methods. For each case, I use election forensic techniques to identify potentially suspicious patterns in precinct-level election results and multilevel regression analysis to show how evidence of election tampering varies according to local and national political conditions. I also draw on field interviews and survey experimental results conducted in Russia, to help discriminate between possible causal explanations for the statistical results. More details on theory-testing are provided in the section on case selection and measurement later in this chapter.
 
## Existing explanations of electoral manipulation, and their limitations

Multiparty elections are the hallmark of modern politics the world over. Most single-party communist states collapsed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and military regimes—largely bereft of their Cold War-era sponsors—have become relatively scarce and short-lived. Multi-party national elections, held in less than fifty percent of countries in 1985, were held in over seventy-five percent by 2005 (Magaloni and Kricheli, 2010). In some cases, multiparty elections have signaled a transition to a more liberal democratic mode of government (Brownlee, 2007; Howard and Roessler, 2006). However, in the bulk of cases, transitions from closed forms of authoritarianism have led to limited electoral democracy, competitive authoritarian regimes, or hegemonic authoritarian systems with one dominant party (Donno, 2013; Hadenius and Teorell, 2007; Levitsky and Way, 2010). In each of these regime types, multiparty elections are held and are conceived of as the only legitimate route to political power, but at the same time are manipulated to varying degrees by governments and political parties.

Due to the prevalence of these elections—unfree and unfair, but still contested and at least somewhat risky for governments—researchers have increasingly worked to understand their function in non-democratic societies. Multiparty elections have been shown to be beneficial for regime longevity on average  (Gandhi, 2008; Gandhi and Lust-Okar, 2009; Gandhi and Przeworski, 2007), in part by helping ruling parties distribute spoils (Blaydes, 2011; Lust-Okar, 2006) and commit to power sharing (Magaloni, 2008), co-opt opposition parties (Reuter and Robertson, 2015), and signal dominance to other political actors (Greene, 2007; Magaloni, 2006). Nevertheless, allowing contested elections creates an opportunity for opposition mobilization, international pressure, and the revelation of citizens’ true preferences, and can sometimes be destabilizing as a result (Brownlee, 2009; Bunce and Wolchik, 2010; Little et al., 2015).

To mitigate these risks, ruling parties in non-democratic states rely on a variety of tools that can unfairly influence the outcome of the election (Schedler, 2002). This toolkit includes methods that involve voters directly, such as vote-buying, voter pressure, and multiple voting, as well techniques where voter contact is not required (such as ballot-stuffing and the falsification of results). All of these techniques are illegal and procedurally illegitimate, even in authoritarian regimes, which exposes the perpetrators of such misdeeds to possible sanctions. The risk that low-level agents of a political party may face criminal or political punishment for illegal/illegitimate activity is a primary driver of the theory of electoral manipulation I elaborate below; as a result, I do not consider legalized forms of electoral manipulation (biased electoral rules or gerrymandering, for example) in this project. There are, however, connections between the theory elaborated in this project and the use of such legalized forms of manipulation in more competitive settings, including in consolidated democracies.

As with holding multiparty elections, election manipulation carries its own risks and benefits. The risks are well known: the possibility of mass protest in response to rigged elections figures prominently in formal models of electoral manipulation (Fearon, 2011; Little, 2012; Magaloni, 2010), as well as in more qualitative studies (Bunce and Wolchik, 2009; Tucker, 2007). More recently, researchers have begun to articulate the stabilizing effects of electoral manipulation. In particular, effective electoral manipulation can send a signal about the ruling party’s organizational capacity and staying power to other political actors, like opposition parties, bureaucrats, and voters (Gehlbach and Simpser, 2015; Simpser, 2013). The ruling party’s ability to sway elections can encourage ambitious politicians to join with the ruling party and help prevent elite splits (Magaloni 2006). Despite these benefits, there is wide variation in the degree to which elections are manipulated (Simpser 2013). 

There have been a number of efforts to understand the causes of variation in the degree to which elections are manipulated, which have yielded a variety of correlates.  These include inequalities in wealth and power (Anderson, 2000; Frye et al., 2017; Lehoucq and Molina, 2002; Ziblatt, 2009). Similarly, poverty has been widely found to facilitate various forms of electoral malfeasance, especially vote-buying (Birch, 2011; Nichter, 2008; Stokes, 2005).  These findings fit into a long scholarly tradition that sees inequality and deprivation as impediments to the development of democracy (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006; Moore, 1993; Rueschemeyer et al., 1992).

Several other socioeconomic conditions have been tied to electoral manipulation.  Dense ethnic networks can also make manipulation more appealing, by easing the monitoring of voters and reducing the likelihood that misdeeds will be exposed (Goodnow and Moser, 2012; Hale, 2007). Voters with higher levels of education are less likely to be targets of vote-buying efforts (Kitschelt and Wilkinson, 2007), while territories with larger populations are correlated with lower levels of manipulation (Larreguy et al., 2016; Nichter, 2008; Simpser, 2013). Finally, researchers have found both positive (Domínguez and McCann, 1996) and negative (Birch, 2011; Lehoucq and Molina, 2002) effects for urbanization on electoral manipulation.

Understanding the socioeconomic predictors of manipulation is important, but by far the most theoretically significant predictor of electoral manipulation is the competitiveness of the election.  An older school of thought held that close elections raise the stakes for the participants, thus increasing the marginal value of a manufactured vote and driving increased manipulation (Argersinger, 1985; Cox and Kousser, 1981; Lehoucq, 2003; Ziblatt, 2009). The role of competitiveness can be modified by other features of the political system.  The winner-take-all nature of single-member electoral districts makes fraud more common in such systems than in those that use proportional representation (Birch, 2007), and high levels of corruption in a state can make the spoils of victory more attractive (Birch, 2011). Similarly, presidential elections are likely to produce higher levels of manipulation, presumably because the stakes are higher in such contests than in legislative elections (Simpser, 2013).

This classic view has been challenged on two fronts. First, Simpser (2013) convincingly argues that uncompetitive regimes are in fact likely to demonstrate the most severe electoral manipulation, as resource-rich, politically unconstrained ruling parties utilize their manipulative resources to send signals of dominance that can deter anti-regime activity by others. The second competitor to the conventional wisdom is presented in a formal model by Rundlett and Svolik (2016). Their model, which articulates principal-agent and collective-action problems inherent in election manipulation, holds that low-level agents will be reluctant to engage in manipulation when they perceive that their political principal is unlikely to win the election (a judgment they make based on the principal’s popularity in the agent’s district).

These two theories make somewhat competing claims, and leave some empirical outcomes unexplained. The signaling model struggles to account for occasions when strong, unrestrained ruling parties fail to deliver the excessive levels of electoral manipulation that the model predicts.  Likewise, the information-based model of Rundlett and Svolik fails to account for scenarios in which deeply unpopular incumbents were nevertheless able to induce local agents to engage in electoral manipulation sufficient to remain in office.  Finally, both models predict uniform changes in electoral manipulation overall. Consequently, they cannot easily account for a growing body of research that many electoral manipulation tactics behave as substitutes, with some techniques increasing in severity even as others decline (Asunka et al., 2017; Harvey, 2016; Kuo and Teorell, 2017; Sjoberg, 2013; van Ham and Lindberg, 2015). 

The framework that I elaborate in this project addresses each of these unresolved questions in the literature on election manipulation. It describes the conditions under which powerful ruling parties might fail to deliver high levels of electoral manipulation—when patronage consolidation begins to break down into rival networks, and/or when local risks to agents become sufficiently widespread to prevent effective manipulation. Similarly, it can account for the success of unpopular incumbents, so long as they can hold their patronage networks together. Finally, by accounting for differential risk levels for agents who engage in dispersed versus centralized manipulation, it explains observed variation in the kinds of manipulation that are observed in different political contexts. 

## Theory in brief

In order to reap the benefits of electoral manipulation, political candidates must rely on large, pyramidal networks of agents to affect the results (Auyero 2007; Hale 2014), raising the possibility that these agents may not always behave as the boss might prefer (Rundlett and Svolik 2016). Throughout this project, I consider a principal to be a national-level executive or party leader, while agents are the front-line individuals tasked with directly influencing election results by illegal means—the individuals who stuff the ballot boxes, buy the votes, and forge the results. As a result, I refer to principal-level effects as national, and agent-level effects as local. However, this model can be adapted to different electoral scales (i.e. the principal could be a mayor at the local scale).

Principals and agents care about different things. Agents care about access to patronage resources—jobs, rents, and other resources—that they can gain as a participant in a political leaders’ election-manipulation network. For example, a neighborhood broker who engages in vote-buying gains access to cash or other benefits (meant for distribution to voters) and may also be rewarded with a political position in the local administration through which additional rents can be extracted (Zarazaga, 2014). A schoolteacher pressed into service as an election administrator, as is common in Russian elections, may face pressure to participate in ballot-stuffing in order to preserve her job, salary, or benefits. The greater share of patronage resources that a political leader controls, the more attractive participation in her network is for agents. This increase in control over patronage resources acts as an incentive for agents to engage in electoral manipulation, increasing the likely severity of tampering with the election.

Political principals can benefit directly from electoral manipulation (Greene 2007; Magaloni 2006), since it improves their chance of winning close elections (Lehoucq and Molina 2002), and widens the margin of victory (Simpser 2013; Gehlbach and Simpser 2015). By contrast, agents perform their assigned tasks in order to remain embedded within a principal’s patronage network. To induce agent cooperation, principals in electoral authoritarian regimes tie access to the state and its associated rents to electoral success (Díaz Cayeros 2006; Lust-Okar 2006; Reuter and Robertson 2012; Reuter & Robertson 2015). This creates a powerful incentive for local agents to boost the principal’s vote-share by whatever means are available, in order to remain within the privileged network. 

However, if the principal appears less likely to control access to patronage due to electoral defeat or intraparty rivalry, her offer of post-election patronage will appear less viable, making it more difficult for principals to credibly commit to rewarding agents (Hale 2006). Following Hale’s (2014) conception of ‘patronal politics,’ I argue that a principal’s ability to credibly promise post-election patronage is contingent on patronage consolidation: the share of resources controlled by her patronage network, relative to those of potential rivals.  To clarify, for a patronage network to exist in the context of election manipulation, there must be continuous links between the political candidate (the principal) and the front-line agent in a particular territory; rewards and favors flow down from the candidate through a series of brokers to the individual agent in a particular local context. It is important to be clear about the distinction between the existence of patronage politics in a country generally, and the degree of consolidation of patronage networks. Patronage politics may be pervasive in a given case, but divided among many competing networks. In such a case, this theory predicts that it will be difficult for any one network to systematically mobilize large numbers of agents.

# Russia chapter

During the 2011 Russian legislative election campaign, the city manager of Izhevsk, a regional capital, was filmed while speaking to a meeting of local veterans’ groups. In the video, city manager Denis Agashin speaks bluntly about the rewards the veterans can expect if they contribute to the ruling party’s victory in the polls. ‘If the party receives less than fifty percent of the vote in your district,’ Agashin declares, ‘that means nothing will change….If the party receives between 50 and 54 percent, we will fund [the local veterans’ groups] with 500,000 rubles.’ Agashin went on to add rewards for even more specific targets up to 1,000,000 rubles for a 60\% vote-share.^[See \url{http://www.newsru.com/russia/30oct2011/agashin.html} for a summary of the event, and the video clip.]  Despite multiple efforts by opposition parties to bring political and criminal penalties against Agashin^[These included efforts to remove him from office, and pressure on the regional prosecutor to bring criminal charges. See \url{http://www.dayudm.ru/article/51302/} (Russian) for details.],  he was largely protected from punishment by the local dominance of the ruling party, United Russia’s. Others have not been so fortunate. For example, in 2009 a district court in Saratov oblast levied a 200,000 ruble fine against the chair of a precinct election commission for falsifying votes in favor of United Russia; still others have received suspended prison sentences.^[A website for the Honest Elections Public Council, a Kremlin-approved non-governmental agency, maintained a list of dozens of other incidents of arrests, administrative charges, and criminal proceedings against individuals who have allegedly helped manipulate an election. The organization and website are now defunct, but an archive is available at \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20170809084414/http://www.chest-vibor.ru/chronicles/}.]  Such punitive outcomes are not uncommon even in a relatively closed case like Russia: after the 2016 legislative election, the Russian Central Election Commission reported 32 criminal cases related to electoral manipulation, in addition to approximately 1,000 administrative cases and 300 fines [@tikhonova2016].

These anecdotes illustrate the personal risk undertaken by those who actually tamper with elections, an aspect of manipulation that has been largely overlooked by research that emphasizes the costs and risks borne by political leaders [@simpser2013;@magaloni2010;@ziblatt2009;@hyde_catch_2011]. A recent principal-agent model of electoral manipulation addresses this gap, by highlighting risks faced by agents if their patron loses the election. However, this emphasis on the risk of electoral defeat does not account for evidence that shows illegal electoral manipulation tactics are often used as substitutes, with one tactic increasing in severity as another declines [@harvey_manipulation_2016;@kuo_teorell_2017;@sjoberg_autocratic_2013]. In particular, some forms of manipulation stubbornly persist even as the risk of patron defeat increases along with growing levels of competition and democratization [@asunka2017electoral;@vanham2015sticks].  

The model presented here helps reconcile these findings by arguing electoral defeat for their patron is not the only risk that agents face. Instead, local political conditions—like active opposition parties or independent courts—can make participation in electoral manipulation costlier for agents, even if their patron remains in power, by increasing the local risks of exposure and political or criminal penalties for the perpetrator. However, agents can insulate themselves from local risks by engaging in forms of manipulation that are harder to observe and trace, such as vote-buying and voter pressure, which helps explain the persistence of these tactics even as political competitiveness increases. These hypotheses are supported by election-forensic analysis of two types of electoral manipulation, using electoral data from more than 90,000 precincts in each election year, across Russia’s eighty-plus regions during six national elections from 2003-2012. 


## Case selection: local and national political conditions in Russia

Russia provides an excellent case with which to test the theory. The country is large and diverse, with wide variation in socioeconomic variables across its 80-plus regions. There is also wide variation in local political opposition, with the ruling party’s margin of victory in the 2011 election ranging from one percentage point in the most competitive regions to 99 points in the least. National patronage consolidation has increased on average during the time period covered here, as regional power centers and oligarchic clans lost influence relative to the Kremlin. This evolution of the national political system, combined with a diversity of local political environments, provides ample opportunity to study agents’ behavior under different conditions. In addition, Russia provides a tough test for the theory. If the principal-agent dynamics proposed here can be detected in Russia, a case where patronage consolidation is relatively high and local constraints are relatively limited in the broader comparative context, principal-agent problems may be even more prevalent in less authoritarian hybrid regimes. 

Institutional reforms, organizational investments in the ruling party, strong economic growth, pressure on outside elites, and consistently high approval ratings for Putin himself strengthened the president’s position as the country’s chief patron. In the 2008 presidential election, the Kremlin successfully performed the transfer of the presidency from Putin to his chosen successor, Medvedev, while Putin took up the role of prime minister. However, as the 2011 Duma and 2012 presidential elections approached, tensions began to appear in the ‘tandem-ocracy’. Commentators began to consider Medvedev and Putin as representatives of ‘liberal’ and ‘conservative’ factions in the elite [@black2014russian]. Speculation about which of the two would run for the presidency in 2012 continued until September 2011, when Medvedev urged the United Russia party conference to endorse Putin for that office. This announcement, and its apparent disregard for the public’s role in the matter, exacerbated divisions in the elite, exemplified by the resignation of long-serving finance minister Alexei Kudrin [@butrin__2011].  In this context, United Russia won only forty-nine percent of the vote and lost more than seventy seats in the Duma---a major setback. In addition, the election prompted widespread allegations of manipulation and large protests in many Russian cities [@buranov__2011]. Since beginning a third term, Putin has re-established the single-pyramid structure of patronage in Russia, after a modest fracturing during his years away from the presidency [@hale_patronal_2014, pp. 267-291].

## Data and measures

In order to test the theory, it is necessary to estimate two types of electoral manipulation: easier-to-monitor administrative falsification and harder-to-monitor vote-buying / voter pressure. To do so, I employ two separate election forensic techniques. I use these methods to estimate the level of both types of electoral manipulation in each of Russia’s regions, per election-year. These models draw on electoral data at the precinct level (more than 90,000 precincts in each election), while second-stage models incorporate control variables at the regional (80+ regions) and election-year levels (10). In both sets of models, I include socioeconomic control variables to incorporate local context [@myagkov_forensics_2009] and reduce the risk of false positives [@deckert2013patterns].

the same techniques used by Harvey [-] to measure vote-buying/ voter-pressure and falsification.





In the original turnout-based measure of electoral manipulation developed by Myagkov et al [-@myagkov_forensics_2009], turnout by precinct in a territory is compared to a party's *absolute vote-share* across the same precincts. Precinct-level absolute vote-share is defined as the number of votes a party receives divided by the total number of eligible voters in the precinct. Increasingly large correlations between these two variables indicate increasingly suspicious results, as they show that---as turnout increases in a region---the party in question is drawing more and more voters to its side from the pool of available voters. Figure \@ref(fig:turnoutfig) provides an illustration of the method.

```


```{r turnoutfig, fig.cap="Overall turnout and absolute vote-share for United Russia (hollow circles) and the KPRF (solid circles) in Leningradskaya Oblast', 2007", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data2007_test, aes(x = turnout)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = ur_abs_vs), shape = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(y = kprf_abs_vs))+
  labs(x = "Turnout", y = "Absolute vote-share") + theme_bw()

```

As the figure shows, there is a markedly different relationship between turnout and absolute vote-share for the ruling party United Russia, and the largest opposition party, the KPRF. For United Russia, higher precinct-level turnout is associated with a consistent increase in its share of the overall electorate. It is important to be clear on what absolute vote-share means. Consider the precincts in Figure \@ref(fig:turnoutfig) in which turnout approached ninety percent; in these precincts, United Russia claimed the votes of approximately seventy percent *of all eligible voters*. In relative terms, this is an even more astonishing feat. Imagine, for arithmetic ease, that such a precinct has 1,000 voters on the rolls. To win 75% of these votes with 90% turnout, United Russia would need to claim 750 out of 900 voters: an eighty-three percent relative share. 

These notional results look much different in the median precinct by turnout (where roughly 54% of eligible voters turned out). In such precincts, United Russia claimed roughly 34% of the eligible voting population. Using our hypothetical list of 1,000 eligible voters, these figures work out to 340 votes for United Russia out of 540 voters; a sixty-three percent relative vote-share. Meanwhile, absolute vote-shares for the primary opposition party have no relationship at all to turnout. Whether forty percent or ninety percent of voters are recorded as casting votes, the Communists claim roughly five percent of the voting population.

A pattern like this can be explained in two ways. First, there could be innocuous explanations. Perhaps turnout and support for the ruling is confounded by a third factor, such as income, education, urban location, or ethnicity. Perhaps, as a notional example, voters are likely to cluster in districts by education, with more educated voters both more likely to turn out *and* more likely to support United Russia. In that view, the suspicious pattern in Figure \@ref(fig:turnoutfig) could be easily explained away: the more educated on average a precinct's voters are, the more likely they are to turn out in droves (and cast their ballots for the ruling party).

The alternative explanation is electoral malfeasance. In that story, a variety of techniques are available for directly inflating the number of votes for the ruling party: e.g., fraud, coerced voting, ballot-stuffing, vote-buying, and multiple voting. Precincts vary in how susceptible they are to such techniques, for many reasons: socioeconomic characteristics, the presence or absence of observers, the skill and dedication of regime agents, and so on. The more susceptible a precinct is to such tampering, the more these techniques can be used to inflate both turnout and the ruling party's *share* of that turnout. While the approach is somewhat different, a similar logic is also used in the widely-cited method for identifying the country-level 'fingerprints' of election manipulation [@Klimek2012;@kobakStatisticalFingerprintsElectoral2016].

Distinguishing between these two stories is crucial to successful election forensics [@deckert2013patterns]. To minimize the risk of false positives---of using forensics analysis to falsely claim fraud [@eggersNoEvidenceSystematic2021]---two precautions should be taken. First, where possible, quantitative analysis should control for possible confounding variables (e.g. socioeconomic factors). Second, and more fundamentally, election forensic tools should be used in coordination with qualitative assessments of overall election integrity by experts and observers. Both approaches are taken in the subsequent analysis. The fragility of election integrity in Russia is well-documented by the domestic monitoring organization Golos, by external observers (e.g. the OSCE), and by international and local experts. I have also included region-level control variables to reduce the risk that cross-regional patterns are confounded by varying levels of income, population size, urbanity, and more across regions.

The measure developed by Myagkov et al [-@myagkov_forensics_2009] captures all forms of direct election manipulation. It does not matter for the tool whether officials stuff pre-filled ballots into the ballot boxes, brokers pay voters to show up and vote multiple times, factory workers are pressured to cast their ballots a certain way, or votes are added to the final tally at the stroke of a pen; any systematic inflation of a party's vote-share may show up in the relationship between turnout and absolute vote-share. This makes it a useful gauge of overall manipulation; it cannot, however, serve as a dependent variable in the present analysis. For the present purpose, election forensic tools must be able to discriminate between centralized techniques like falsification, and more dispersed techniques like voter pressure and ballot stuffing.

With regard to these less centralized techniques, I use a modified version of the turnout-based measure proposed by Myagkov et al [-@myagkov_forensics_2009] by comparing the share of votes cast by absentee ballot and mobile ballot-box to the ruling party’s absolute vote-share across precincts using a first-stage multilevel model [@harvey_manipulation_2016;@Moser2017]. Absentee ballots have consistently been used in Russia to facilitate vote-buying, workplace mobilization, and multiple voting [@golos_analytical_2011;@frye2014;@white2011elections], until they were phased out in 2018. Russian electoral law provides for the use of a mobile ballot box, which is---in theory---brought by election officials to voters who are homebound, hospitalized, or otherwise unable to physically visit the polling place on election day. In practice, however, the mobile ballot box also creates easy opportunities for ballot-stuffing by officials. In particular, by removing electoral officials and the ballot box from the polling place, it limits observers' ability to monitor officials' behavior.

Election reporting by the civil society group Golos provides examples of how this process can work. In one instance in the 2011 election, the Golos report notes "The chair of the [precinct electoral] commission did not announce the beginning of the mobile voting, or show the register [of mobile voters]." This violation of procedure allows election officials to stuff the mobile ballot box with whatever number of votes for the ruling party is needed. As the report continues, "Afterward, 296 people were on the list, which is too many for voting at home. All 296 people were visited in 1.5 hours" [@golos2012]. The authorities have continued to rely on such methods in subsequent elections. By 2021 (when absentee voting was no longer permissible), Golos recorded 715 procedural violations related to the mobile ballot box; this was the second-largest category of violations, accounting for 16 percent of all observed violations [@KartaNarusheniyTri2021].      

To construct an election-forensic measure of voter pressure, ballot-stuffing, and similar techniques, I replace overall turnout in the Myagkov et al model with 'nonstandard' turnout. Nonstandard, here, is shorthand for ballots cast by absentee and the mobile ballot box. The measure is generated for each of Russia's regions by comparing a party's absolute vote-share is to turnout by absentee and mobile ballot box. An increasingly large correlation between nonstandard turnout and a party's absolute vote-share indicates the party is drawing increasingly large proportions of the nonstandard vote. The steps taken to construct the measure are as follows.

Precinct-level election data was obtained from the Russian Central Election Commission for national election-years 2001, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2016, 2018, and 2021. The constitutional referendum held in 2020, which (among other things) enabled President Putin to prolong his tenure in office, is not included.^[The national referendum, the first since 1993, was excluded because of its distinctiveness as a case. While it was a political campaign, it did not involve opposing parties or candidates on the ballot. While the primary function of the constitutional reform was to 'reset' President Putin's term count to zero (allowing him to bypass constitutional term limits) the reform package was salted with 205 additional changes to the constitution to appeal to various constituencies [@teagueRussiasConstitutionalReforms2020], a prospect which complicates election-forensic interpretations of the vote. Finally, the vote itself took place during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, which introduced all manner of procedural changes and ad hoc administrative decisions to the administration of the vote [@hutchesonConsolidatingPutinRegime2021].] For each election year, a multilevel regression analysis was performed on the precinct-level data, using a party's absolute vote-share as the dependent variable and nonstandard turnout as the independent variable. The multilevel models incorporate random slopes and intercepts by region. The random intercepts allow for the party's baseline absolute vote-share in the absence of any non-standard votes to vary across regions. The random slopes allow the relationship between non-standard turnout and absolute vote-share to vary by region, producing the regression coefficients that are used as measures of decentralized election manipulation in the second stage.

```


Note: We need to mention homogeneity of precincts at some point around here.


Next graf: Fraud measures (deviance)

The second measure of electoral manipulation must capture falsification of results only. The digits-based test proposed by Beber and Scacco [-@beber2012] has been useful for estimating falsification of results by election officials [@weidmann_violence_2013;@sjoberg_autocratic_2013;@Cantu2014;@harvey_manipulation_2016]. Their method rests on the assumption that the ones-digit for a party's vote totals across precincts in a territory should be uniformly distributed in a clean election. That is, in the absence of human intervention, a roughly equal number of precincts should report vote totals ending in 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. Put another way, whether the number of people who turn up to vote for a particular party at a given polling place is 100, 101, 102, etc., is a highly random process, influenced by (among other things) the weather, individuals' moods and obligations, conditions on the evening commute, and so on. Figure \@ref(fig:digitsuniform) illustrates this tendency using precinct-level votes for the KPRF candidate in Moscow city in the 2012 election.

However, as Beber and Scacco demonstrate, human beings are poor random number generators; when asked to produce 'random' numbers they tend to overestimate some integers (especially zeroes and fives), and underestimate others. As a result, when precinct-level election officials are tasked with inflating a party's vote total at their precinct, they tend to over-produce certain digits. This process, when aggregated hundreds or thousands of times, can result in non-uniform distributions across the territory---a signal of human electoral falsification. Figure \@ref(fig:digitsfalse) illustrates a non-uniform distribution of digits, with significant over-representation of zeroes, for the KPRF candidate in Dagestan in the 2012 election. This type of election forensic measure captures falsification only; election results may be highly influenced by vote-buying, voter pressure, or ballot-stuffing and still generate randomly distributed last digits [@harvey_manipulation_2016].

```



To estimate one form of manipulation by formal agents—falsification of results—I conduct chi-square tests for the uniform distribution of trailing digits for the ruling party and the second-place finisher in each region per election-year.  In an election without administrative fraud, the trailing digits for each party should be roughly evenly distributed from 0 to 9.  I test for deviations from the uniform that are statistically significant at the .05 level for both parties ; the binary variable any fraud is marked as 1 if either party’s results are significantly non-uniform, and 0 otherwise. This variable is used as the dependent variable in a second-stage logit model. This approach measures falsification of results only; it does not measure behaviors like stuffing the ballot box with pre-filled ballots [@Sjoberg2016].

there is likely to be a core of precincts that reflect more-or-less the true level of turnout and support for United Russia in the region. Votes in these precincts are subject to less---and less direct---forms of manipulation. Like all voters in the system, they experience the effects of media bias, incumbent resource advantages, and selective access to the ballot. However, they are less subject to artificial inflation of the ruling party's vote-share through . The more the voters in a precinct are subject to the latter forms of electoral malfeasance---due to a lack of election monitors, socioeconomic conditions, or other factors---

a larger positive correlation between the share of absentee ballots and United Russia’s absolute vote-share is more indicative of these kinds of manipulation (especially after controlling for demographic factors that might affect honest use of absentee ballots).  The regression coefficient linking absentee voting and ruling-party vote-share is used as the dependent variable in a second-stage feasible generalised least squares (FGLS) regression to account for the fact that the dependent variable is itself a regression estimate [@Lewis2005].  

### Explanatory variables: local political constraint

I operationalize local constraints, first, by using a measure of \textit{local partisan opposition}. I include two additional measures in the appendix: expert ratings of the \textit{openness} of the local political environment to social and political activity, and a dummy variable recording whether a region is a titular \textit{ethnic republic} within the Russian Federation.  Local opposition is constructed by finding United Russia’s margin of victory proportional-representation portion of the most recent regional legislative election prior to the national election at hand (that is, the measure is lagged and taken at a lower administrative level). In rare cases where United Russia lost the regional election, its margin of victory is negative. I subtract the margin of victory from one, so that higher values correspond to a larger opposition presence. However, regional legislative election results are not available prior to the 2004 national election. In order to include data from 2004 and 2003, I rely on the margin of victory in gubernatorial elections.^[Similarly, the results of gubernatorial elections cannot be used for all elections, since Russia abolished gubernatorial elections between 2005 and 2012.]^[There is a clear difference between the two types of elections that affects the value of competitiveness when measured in this way. The proportional nature of legislative elections allows more parties to be competitive, systematically narrowing the margin of victory in these elections. By contrast, the winner-take-all nature of the election tends to make these elections two-way contests, possibly producing wider margins of victory. To account for this difference, I first center and scale each variable according to its variance before combining them. The distribution of these variables is sufficiently similar that the benefit of being able to make use of the data from the 2003 and 2004 elections in the study outweighs the cost of combining them in this fashion. Histograms for the raw and scaled data are available in the appendix.]  

It may be objected using margins of victory in one election (regardless of the timing and level) to explain electoral manipulation in another election introduces a problematic level of endogeneity to the analysis. I use the variable for two reasons. First, it captures the ability of opposition parties in the regional legislature to criticize the regional administration, to mobilize supporters, to influence regional election commissions, and to divert patronage resources away from the ruling party—all of which are constraints that make pro-regime manipulation more difficult. Second, the empirical strategy uses local opposition to predict levels of two distinct types of manipulation, not the level of overall manipulation or United Russia’s success in national elections. In other words, while it is true that a wide margin of victory in a regional election may be indicative of a high level of manipulation in that election, and thus be uninformative about the overall level of electoral manipulation in a federal election in the same territory, it says nothing about the type of manipulation that may have been used—which is the dependent variable of interest.  Finally, as robustness checks, I include two non-electoral measures of local constraints in the appendix, discussed above. Both of these variables produce results that are substantively similar to those presented here. 

### Explanatory variables: national consolidation



### Control variables

Several socioeconomic variables are known to influence the likelihood and severity of electoral manipulation, and are included in all models. In addition, some control variables must be included in order to account for potentially non-manipulative explanations for suspicious patterns in the electoral data. Including these variables is also important since limited within-region variability during the ten years covered here makes a fixed-effects model less useful. I discuss these variables below. All socioeconomic controls are taken from the Russian Federal State Statistical Service.

Since large populations may be more difficult to control and require more resources to manipulate, I include a measure of the \textit{population size} in each region. The number of \textit{pensioners} per 1,000 residents in a region is included, since many pensioners are directly dependent on the state for their livelihoods and may be easier to pressure into voting for the ruling party (a problem that is particularly acute for residents of homes for the elderly). Additionally, pensioners may be disposed to vote as a group for or against government candidates [@colton2003popular;@hemment_sovietstyle_2009]. Poverty is well known to affect individuals’ susceptibility to vote-buying efforts and other forms of clientelism [@kitschelt2007;@stokes2013brokers]. Consequently I include a measure of the percentage of the population falling below the official poverty line. A similar logic applies to the unemployed; I include a measure of the official unemployment rate for each region. Researchers have found mixed effects for the degree of urbanization on electoral manipulation, and so I include a measure of the percentage of a region’s population living in cities. 

Higher levels of education among the population should make vote-buying and similar forms of manipulation more difficult. As a measure of the level of education among the population of a region, I include the number of individuals with \textit{higher education} (bachelor’s degrees and above) per 1,000 residents. Since they owe their employment to the state, \textit{government employees} may be more vulnerable to political pressure than ordinary voters [@kitschelt2007]. I include a measure of the size of government in each region by adding the number of employees of the regional and local governments, and dividing by 1,000 residents. Finally, I include a dummy variable to control for \textit{presidential elections}, which may produce higher levels of manipulation due to their high stakes for incumbents [@simpser2013]. 

To my knowledge, the correlates of ‘honest’ voting by absentee in Russia have not been tested.  However, several of these variables are also plausible controls for non-manipulative absentee voting. Use of an absentee certificate allows an individual to vote in person at a precinct other than where they are registered, meaning that a more mobile population is likely to generate more honest absentee ballots. Large urban centers might draw more economic migrants and generally foster more internal movement, as may regions with a more highly educated population, while pensioners may be less likely to find themselves outside their precinct on election day.

A variable like patronage consolidation is not easily visible; the concept describes informal networks of responsibility between patrons and clients, and the degree to which patrons must compete among themselves for the service of clients. Measures like GDP, GINI, or the oil price may capture the wealth of the overall patronage system, but not the interaction of competing networks within the system (Hale 2014, p. 33). A measure of the number of presidential loyalists in cabinet positions, for example, would likewise represent only a partial picture; loyalty is difficult to observe, and loyalists may also be stationed in major industries, important governorships, and in the security ministries. Instead, I use the variable \textit{UR governors share}, which indicates the percentage of regional governors formally affiliated with the ruling party, United Russia. This variable captures the gradual consolidation of regional political machines under the influence of the Kremlin during the time period covered, as previously independent politicians joined the party and brought their autonomous political machines into the fold [@Reuter2010,Reuter2013}. While this measure may not be universally applicable, United Russia’s importance as a political party is largely tied to the ability of its high-ranking members to channel patronage resources to their clients [@Remington2008,Reuter2009,Turovskii2010}. Over time, the measure ranges from .28 in 2003 to .66 in 2012. As a robustness check in the appendix, I also use a measure of centralized executive power from the Polity dataset. To test the implications of the incumbent-popularity model of manipulation, I use the average approval rating of Vladimir Putin in the three months before the election, gathered in representative nationwide polls conducted by the independent Levada Center, a respected Russian polling organization.
